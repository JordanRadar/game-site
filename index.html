    <p>Thanks for visiting my web site! This will be a place where I catalog and provide brief reviews of the video games I've finished over the years. I've been taking notes since 2017, with more detailed notes being created in 2020. Hope I can expand your horizons or provide some insight as to my personal tastes! Enjoy!</p>
