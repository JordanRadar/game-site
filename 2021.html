    <h2>2021</h2>
    <p>This is a year in progress, as you can see. Due to school, I have significantly less time, but I've still played some absolutely killer stuff. There's also a lot coming out later in the year that I hope to get to at some point. Guess we'll see...</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Half-Life: Restored [PC] 1/25 (It's Half Life, but with some of the cut stuff replaced. Yahoo.)</li>
    <li>Need for Speed: Underground [PC] 3/13 (Excellent game, possibly the most influential racing game of all time. Horrid rubberband AI, however.)</li>
    <li>Call of Duty: Black Ops [PC] 3/20 (Pretty good. Very interesting story, but the campaign's level design leaves something to be desired. It was cool flying a helicopter and commanding a squad in the air, and they didn't overstay their welcome. Can't wait to see where the story goes after this one!)</li>
    <li>Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut [PC] 3/27 (Finished it on HARD and while it took some doing, I did it. Had to abuse the AI and hitboxes to do it because enemies do a ton of damage while healing items barely give you any health back. Makes things tense, though, so I do recommend it.)</li>
    <li>Resident Evil 3 Remake [PC] 4/17 (Really good remake. It unfortunately had the unenviable task of following up RE2, which is rough. I'd be incline to give it an 8 or 9, but the constant performance issues I had make me want to give it a 6 or 7. Micro stutters and multi-second freezes galore. I know it isn't my machine, because it runs RE2 on highest with no issue, whatsoever. No clue what the issue is, and looking it up is inconclusive. Such a damper on a fun experience.)</li>
    <li>Yakuza: Like a Dragon [PC] 6/4 (I say this without a hint of irony or hyperbole. Yakuza 7 is the best game I've ever played in my life. It is perfect. EDIT: Ok maybe its not that perfect, but it is super duper good.)</li>
    <li>Resident Evil VILLAGE [PC] 6/12 (Superb RE game. I'm definitely gonna be putting time into this one to complete it.)</li>
    </ol>
