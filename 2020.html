    <h2>2020</h2>
    <p>You might notice that most of these games were completed in the first half of the year. This is because of...world events...we'll say. These events caused my workplace to close for a few months and I had some free time to finally spend doing my hobbies. Having all that free time was nice, though.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Dead Rising [PC] 1/23 (Such a great game. Once you get used to its weird timetable, its so much fun.) [Saint Run]</li>
    <li>Turok [SWITCH] 1/30 (Pretty good game. Excellent port. Aside from the odd frame drop here and there, I can't complain. Cool weapons and enemy design.)</li>
    <li>Brutal DooM 2 [PC] 2/19 (It's definitely DooM. Man some of those levels are hot garbage.)</li>
    <li>Devil May Cry V [PC] 2/19 (Definitely my second favorite DMC game. Only behind DmC. Kidding. It's only behind DMC2.)</li>
    <li>Death Stranding [PS4] 3/4 (Wow. Just wow.)</li>
    <li>Yakuza 4 [PS4] 3/21 (My new favorite third Yakuza game. Behind 0 and Kiwami 2.)</li>
    <li>Black Mesa [PC] 3/25 (A fantastic recreation of a fantastic game. Moreso supplementary playing rather than a replacement, but still very nice. It was a long time coming, but here we are. I wonder what they have in the pipeline up next...)</li>
    <li>Gravity Rush [PS4] 3/26 (Definitely a Vita game. Traversal is fun, but the combat is lame. Story is kinda lame, too. Hopefully the second one is a better experience.)</li>
    <li>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare [PC] 3/27 (I see why this was the format that CoD followed for eons to come. It's cinematic, but as for level design? It's no Half-Life. Or Quake. Or Doom. Or anything else with actual level design.)</li>
    <li>Call of Duty: World at War [PC] 4/1 (Prefer it to 4, since its plenty cinematic while also having better setpieces and more interesting levels.)</li>
    <li>King's Field (JP) [PSX] 4/24 (Still better than Dark Souls 2. Surprisingly playable for a 1994 PSX launch game. Supposedly the first fully 3D game on the system, but I'm too lazy to check.)</li>
    <li>King's Field(2 JP) (US) [PSX] 4/27 (Very fun and interesting game that isn't really hampered in any major way by the hardware. Not sure whether I prefer the original or not, but this is definitely a more open and expansive game.)</li>
    <li>Dead Rising 2 [PC] 5/6 (Really good. I dunno if I prefer it to the original, but I definitely prefer Frank West to Chuck Greene. Overall, Chuck is just kinda...milquetoast? I dunno. Still an excellent game.)</li>
    <li>My Friend Pedro [PC] 5/15 (Pretty fun shooter. Like Hotline Miami but 2D. Also easier. Still good.)</li>
    <li>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater [PSx] 5-22 (The original. Still fun to this day.)</li>
    <li>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 [PSX] 5-23 (The vastly superior sequel.)</li>
    <li>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 [PSX] 5-24 (The improved third game, but on the PSX. What an oddity.)</li>
    <li>Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX [PSX] 5-26 (It's like Pro Skater 1 but not fun in the slightest. Just play the next game.)</li>
    <li>Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX [PSX] 5-30 (Genuinely an excellent extreme sports game. Like Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX but actually fun. Physics can be really jank but whatevs.)</li>
    <li>Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb [PC] 6-25 (Still one of my favorite games of all time.)</li>
    <li>Hot Wheels Turbo Racing [PSX] 7-5 (Decent little racer. Surprisingly doesn't do the trope of small cars in a huge, real life area. Still does well.)</li>
    <li>Chex Quest HD [PC] 7-20 (Pretty ok remake of the original. The music is bangin, for sure. Unfortunately, the animations are a little stiff and you can't quicksave/quickload, and the FOV is a little close. If the game had some more tuning for stuff like that, it'd be a definite reccomendation. Doesn't require having played the original, either.)</li>
    <li>Gran Turismo 2 [Simulation Mode] [PSX] 7-21 (Gran Turismo, but more. Dunno what really to say.)</li>
    <li>The Last of Us Part 2 [PS4] 7-27 (No words to describe this descent into madness. Except that. It's a descent into selfish madness and revenge.)</li>
    <li>Super Mario 64 [PC] 8-9 (Played it with the SGI models and it made it feel like it felt when I was a kid. Really good game, overall. Not surprising how every 3D Mario game followed suit.)</li>
    <li>Far Cry 3 [PC] 8-22 (Superb open world game. Last quarter/second island were a little boring, both in mission lineup and area appearance. The last couple missions were also a little lame, but I definitely see why Ubisoft copied the formula for every other game after this. Can't catch lightning in a bottle, but you can sure stand in an open field with a rake during a thunderstorm.)</li>
    <li>Postal [PC] 8-30 (This sure is a video game. I dunno if I would've played it if it wasn't free.)</li>
    <li>Postal 2 [PC] 9-4 (One of the crudest games I've ever played. It's kinda fun in some places, but it's kinda hard to get around sometimes. It crashed twice in my almost 4 hour playthrough, but I fired it right back up afterward. This could also be the most different sequel I've played in a while. Postal 1 is a depressing dive into the actions of a crazy person. Postal 2 is that crazy person doing some menial goals in his own special way. It's just...very strange. Like if all of Adult Swim was allowed to make their own game.)</li>
    <li>Katana ZERO [PC] 9-6 (It's like Hotline Miami but 2D, and the timing is a little iffy. Especially for parries and dodges. Kinda hard to get used to. Can't wait for the DLC.)</li>
    <li>Devil May Cry 3 [HARD] [PC] 9-24 (It's interesting to believe that this was the original "normal" difficulty for the first release. Hm)</li>
    <li>Devil May Cry 3 [VERGIL] [PC] 10-2 (Where's your motivation? Foolishness, Dante. Foolishness. Might controls everything.)</li>
    <li>Devil May Cry 4 [VERGIL] [PC] 10-5 (Vergil being in DMC4 mad</li>e me actually like DMC4. That's all.)
    <li>Final Fantasy VII Remake [PS4] 11-25 (The Unknown Journey Will Continue)</li>
    <li>Yakuza 5 [PS4] 12-17 (Really great Yakuza game. I don't know if I'll ever go for 100% cuz that'll probably take like 200 hours but rest assured I'll do it.)</li>
    </ol>
