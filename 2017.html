    <h2>2017</h2>
    <p>This year was fairly light as this was just when I started taking notes about the games I completed. I wasn't even writing about them. Just keeping a list. It's my personal opinion that 2017 was a killer year for gaming. There were so many absolutely fabulous games that came out. Truly a year of modern classics. But like I said, I wasn't necessarily taking notes on when I completed games, so these are in an approximate order.</p>
